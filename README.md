## Overview

Sign language detection is a crucial step toward making communication more inclusive for individuals with hearing impairments. This project leverages cutting-edge machine learning techniques to detect sign language gestures in real time using the Mediapipe library and OpenCV.

By harnessing the power of computer vision, this project aims to provide a practical solution for translating sign language into text, thereby bridging the communication gap between those who are deaf or hard of hearing and the rest of the world.

## Project Objectives

- **Real-time Detection**: Utilize Mediapipe's holistic model to detect hand and body gestures in real-time video streams.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Collect and preprocess keypoint data from sign language gestures to create labeled datasets for training and testing.
- **Model Evaluation**: Implement and evaluate the model's performance in recognizing and translating sign language gestures accurately.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide a straightforward interface that allows users to interact with the model and view results seamlessly.

## Key Features

- **Holistic Detection Model**: Utilizes Mediapipe's holistic model, which integrates hand, pose, and facial landmarks for comprehensive gesture recognition.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Implements robust data preprocessing techniques to ensure high-quality input data for model training.
- **Real-time Evaluation**: Capable of processing and evaluating video input in real time, providing immediate feedback on detected gestures.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. The main libraries used include Mediapipe and OpenCV.

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
```
## Project Structure

- **Data Collection**: The project begins by collecting keypoint data for various sign language gestures. This involves capturing video frames, detecting keypoints using the holistic model, and storing these for further processing.
- **Preprocessing**: After data collection, preprocessing steps are applied to clean and organize the data. Labels are created to correspond with the gestures captured.
- **Model Training & Testing**: The collected and preprocessed data is used to train machine learning models that can recognize sign language gestures. Various models and techniques can be evaluated for performance.
- **Real-time Application**: Once trained, the model is integrated into a real-time application where it can detect and interpret sign language gestures as they occur.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Start the application by executing the main script. Ensure your webcam or video source is enabled and accessible.
   
2. **Real-time Detection**: The application will begin detecting gestures in real time. The detected gestures will be translated into text and displayed on the screen.

3. **Evaluation**: The model's performance can be evaluated using the provided test datasets. Modify the preprocessing or model parameters to improve accuracy and robustness.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expand Gesture Database**: Increase the variety of sign language gestures to improve the model's applicability.
- **Improve Model Accuracy**: Experiment with different machine learning models and preprocessing techniques to enhance detection accuracy.
- **Deploy as a Web App**: Extend the project's accessibility by deploying it as a web application, allowing users to interact with it via their browsers.
